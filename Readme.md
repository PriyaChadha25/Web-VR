For additional Practice-> <br />
(1) Visit: https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/<br />
Here, choose geometry and then choose primitive. check the options shown after choosing the primitive. Those options would be the attributes of the shape here.<br />
(2) Visit: https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/primitives/a-torus-knot.html<br />
Just Change the last word from a-torus-knot to a-circle or a-triangle, etc. (shape name) to check some more attributes. Remember to put position (according to the plane) with them for visibility.<br />
